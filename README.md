# SemesterProject2 - Vintage$Brokers

![readme-img]()

This is the repository for my semester project 2 at Noroff for Christmas 2023. the task was to use the skills we had learned over the past three semesters an create an auction site.

## Description

This is my end of the third semester project at Noroff. We had five weeks to plan our approach with a Gannt chart & a Kanban project board, design a prototype in Figma and then build an auction site using the Noroff Auction API. We also had to use a CCS Framework, so I chose Bootstrap since we had worked with that previously. The content is dynamically built by fetching data from the API. The API is a bit limited so some things are handled a bit creative, like fetching all the user auction wins.

### User Stories

Our Auction site had to fulfill some specific user stories:

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may logout
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view their total credit
- A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
- A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing
- A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
- An unregistered user may search through Listings

### Design Choices

We could design the site as we wanted, but had to remember what we had learned about user accessability and UX design the previous semesters.
After some brainstorming, the style I was aiming for was a vintage luxurious site, that specialized in expensive vintage clothes and jewelry. I wanted the site te feel classic and luxurious so I went for black, gold and kings blue. It was difficult to work with the gold color, since i could no get it to look gold enough, as it looked more yellow than gold.
